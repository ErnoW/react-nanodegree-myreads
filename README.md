# MyReads Project
This is the **MyReads** app, part of the [Nanodegree React course](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) at Udacity. 

## Quick start
* Clone this repo
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the development server with `npm start`
* The app will run on `localhost:3000`

## Test
* To run the tests, run `npm test`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Bootstrapped
* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
* As foundation for this project, [provided starter files](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) from Udacity were used.

## Contributing
This project is part of my React Nanodegree course at Udacity. It doesn't make any sense for me to accept contributions.

## Author
